A basic backend process using agents for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) involves a pipeline that extracts, processes, and embeds data from a traditional database into a vector database for efficient retrieval. An "agent" adds dynamic, intelligent decision-making to the process, allowing for more complex tasks than a simple, static workflow. 
The flow can be broken down into the following stages:

1. Extraction and agent initiation
The process begins with an agent—or an orchestration layer—that manages the overall workflow. This agent is responsible for starting and monitoring the data pipeline.
Orchestration agent: A master agent (or a scheduler like Airflow) triggers the process, either on a schedule (e.g., daily, weekly) or based on an event, such as a change in the source database.
Database agent: This agent is responsible for securely connecting to the source database.
It executes a query (e.g., a SQL statement) to retrieve the raw data that needs to be vectorized. This could be a full table dump, an incremental change-log, or a filtered result set.
The agent then passes the retrieved raw data (e.g., text, JSON) to the next stage of the pipeline. 

2. Data preparation
Once the data is extracted, a data-focused agent cleans and structures it to make it suitable for embedding.
Preprocessing agent: This agent performs a series of transformations on the raw text data.
Cleaning: Removes noise, such as HTML tags, extra whitespace, or special characters.
Normalization: Standardizes the text format.
Chunking agent: This agent divides large documents or text blocks into smaller, more manageable "chunks".
Chunking is crucial because large language models (LLMs) have a limited context window, and smaller chunks are more effective for a similarity search.
The chunking strategy can be simple (e.g., splitting by a fixed character count) or more advanced (e.g., splitting by sentences or using semantic chunking). 

3. Embedding and storage
After the data is prepared, an agent converts it into dense vector embeddings and stores the results in the vector database.
Embedding agent: This agent uses a pre-trained embedding model to convert each text chunk into a high-dimensional vector.
For example, the text "machine learning" is converted into a list of numbers, like [0.12, 0.05, ..., 0.78].
The embedding model is chosen based on factors like performance, cost, and the specific needs of the use case.
Vector database agent: This agent handles the interaction with the vector database.
It creates a connection and inserts the newly generated vector embeddings, along with the original text chunk and any associated metadata, into the database.
Metadata (e.g., a source ID, creation date) is critical for future retrieval and filtering. 

4. Continuous synchronization
A fully agentic system can handle updates and deletions to the source data automatically, ensuring the vector database remains fresh and relevant.
Change detection agent: This agent monitors the source database for changes.
It can either run a periodic check for new or modified records or be triggered by database events (e.g., triggers, change data capture).
Update/delete agent: If changes are detected, this agent orchestrates the necessary actions.
Update: It fetches the new content, runs it through the preprocessing and embedding steps, and then updates the corresponding entry in the vector database.
Deletion: It removes the corresponding vector and metadata from the vector database. 
The complete end-to-end flow
Trigger: The Orchestration Agent initiates the process.
Extract: The Database Agent pulls new or updated data from the relational database.
Process: The Preprocessing Agent cleans the text, and the Chunking Agent breaks it into small, meaningful pieces.
Embed: The Embedding Agent transforms each chunk into a vector.
Store: The Vector Database Agent ingests the vector, text, and metadata into the vector database.
Maintain: The Change Detection Agent continuously monitors the source database for changes, ensuring the vector store is always up-to-date. 



------------

In this context, an "agent" can be implemented in several ways, from a simple script to a complex, containerized microservice. The best approach depends on the complexity, scalability, and maintainability required for your backend process. Here's a breakdown of the physical structure options: 

Option 1: Monolithic script
This is the simplest implementation, where the entire RAG flow is contained within a single executable file or script, such as a Python script.
Structure: A single Python script (process.py) containing the code to connect to the database, extract data, call the embedding model, and store the results in the vector database.
Pros:
Simplicity: Easy to develop and test locally.
Low overhead: No complex infrastructure is needed.
Cons:
Limited reusability: Logic is tightly coupled and hard to reuse for other processes.
Scalability issues: Cannot easily scale specific parts of the process, like the embedding step, if it becomes a bottleneck.
No fault tolerance: A single failure takes down the entire process. 

Option 2: Orchestrated script
This approach separates the individual functions (extraction, embedding, etc.) into different scripts or functions managed by an orchestrator.
Structure:
extract_data.py: A Python script to connect to and extract data from the database.
embed_data.py: A Python script to take the extracted data and produce embeddings.
store_data.py: A Python script to save the data and embeddings to the vector database.
Orchestrator: A tool like Apache Airflow or a simple scheduler (e.g., cron) that calls these scripts sequentially.
Pros:
Modularity: You can reuse or replace individual components easily.
Clear separation of concerns: Each script has a single responsibility.
Cons:
Still limited: Can be less robust than a more advanced containerized setup. 

Option 3: Containerized microservices (recommended for production)
For a robust and scalable production system, the best practice is to encapsulate each agent's functionality within its own Docker container. This creates an architecture of independent microservices. 
Structure:
Database Agent container: A Docker container that runs the data extraction script. It has its own isolated dependencies and environment variables for database credentials.
Embedding Agent container: A container running the embedding script. It might have specific machine learning libraries and access to an embedding model (e.g., via a cloud API).
Vector Database Agent container: A container running the script for inserting data into the vector database.
Orchestration layer: A service like Docker Compose, Kubernetes, or a cloud-managed service (e.g., Google Cloud Run, AWS ECS) manages the communication and execution of these containers.
Pros:
Isolation: Dependencies for each component are isolated, preventing conflicts.
Scalability: You can scale each container independently based on demand. For example, if embedding is compute-heavy, you can run multiple Embedding Agent containers in parallel.
Portability: The containers can run on any platform that supports Docker, whether on-premises or in the cloud.
Fault tolerance: The failure of one container does not necessarily bring down the entire pipeline, as the orchestration layer can restart it.
Maintainability: Easier to manage and update individual services without affecting the entire system.
Cons:
Initial complexity: Requires more setup and infrastructure knowledge.
